                <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                    Huntington’s disease is a rare genetic condition that affects the function of the brain. It is caused by a
                    change or ‘mutation’ in the Huntington gene (HTT) that affects the brain and can be passed down from
                    parents to children. If a person carries the mutation in the HTT gene, they will develop the condition at some point in their life, but there is no way of knowing when their symptoms will begin. This is known as ‘delayed-onset’ and with symptoms usually starting between the ages of 30 and 50.
                </p>
                <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                    Sufferers of Huntington’s disease gradually develop a range of symptoms that affect movement, thinking, and behaviour, with symptoms becoming more severe over time. One of the earliest signs is uncontrollable, dance-like movements of the arms, legs, face, or body. These movements become stronger and more exaggerated as the disease progresses, and over time can turn into stiffness and rigidity, sometimes leaving a person unable to walk. Many people also develop abnormal body postures, slurred speech, and significant weight loss because feeding and swallowing become difficult, and choking is more likely.
                </p>
                <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                    Huntington’s disease also affects the brain in ways that change a person’s behaviour, emotions, and personality. Thinking and decision-making become harder, and these cognitive problems get worse over time. Eventually, people may no longer be able to work, drive, manage money, or care for themselves. When these thinking and memory problems become severe enough to interfere with daily life, it is known as dementia.
                </p>
                <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                    There is currently no treatment that can cure or reverse Huntington’s disease, but some symptoms can be managed. Medicines can help reduce uncontrolled movements, support people with psychological or behavioural problems, and treat depression and anxiety. However, some of these medicines can cause side effects, and in certain cases they may make movement or other symptoms worse.
                </p>
                <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                    Scientists do have the ability to test for the mutation in the HTT gene that causes the disease. This test can be done either prenatally (during pregnancy) or in adults (before symptoms appear). This can give clarity on if the individual will develop the disease, however it also raises some very difficult decisions.
                </p>
                <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
                    This leads us to ask, if there is a test for Huntington’s disease, a serious health condition with no cure, should we use it? And if we do… who should we test? Adults only or unborn babies as well? These are the questions at the heart of Huntington’s disease and the focus of this project.

                <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                    Huntington's disease is caused by a change in a single gene called the HTT gene. This gene contains a short piece of DNA that repeats the same sequence over and over again - the letters C-A-G (each represents a base of DNA).
                </p>
                <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                    You can think of this as a word typed many times in a row: CAGCAGCAGCAGCAG…
                </p>
                <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                    The HTT gene normally makes a protein that helps brain cells stay healthy. When the CAG repeat becomes too long, the protein becomes faulty and does not work as well, meaning the brain does not work as well. This faulty protein slowly damages brain cells over many years, leading to symptoms.
                </p>
                <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                    Every person has some number of these CAG repeats.

                    <li>Most people have a small number, which is completely harmless.</li>
                    <li>People with Huntington's have a much larger number of repeats than normal.</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                    This is called a repeat expansion.
                </p>

                    <li><strong>35 or fewer repeats</strong> → the person will not develop Huntington's and cannot pass it on.</li>
                </ul>

                    The number of repeats a person has can influence how severe the disease is, as influences: the age symptoms begin, and how quickly the condition progresses. In general, the more CAG repeats there are, the earlier the onset of symptoms, and the fewer repeats (but still in the disease range) means later onset. However, the exact timing still varies from person to person.

                    Anticipation can occur when the number of repeats of CAG increases in the next generation, as so symptoms appear earlier. This is more likely to happen when the gene is inherited from the father.

                <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                    There are two main types of tests for Huntington’s disease: prenatal testing, which looks at a baby’s DNA during pregnancy, and adult predictive testing, where an adult can choose to find out whether they inherited the Huntington’s disease mutation.
                </p>
                <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                    Prenatal testing can be offered during pregnancy to check whether a developing baby has Huntington's disease-causing mutation. This is usually done using either chorionic villus sampling (CVS) or amniocentesis - both forms of testing a foetus using a small sample of the baby’s genetic material. This type of testing is normally offered only to parents who feel they would consider a termination if the baby tested positive. Prenatal testing is arranged through specialist clinical genetics units.
                </p>
                <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                    Adults aged 18 or over can choose to have a test to find out whether they carry the Huntington’s disease mutation. This process is done through a clinical genetics service, and includes several appointments with a genetic counsellor. These sessions help people think carefully about whether they want the test, how they might feel about the result, and whether testing is the right decision for them. Support from genetic counsellors is also available after the test to help people understand their result and cope emotionally. Sometimes results fall into a grey area (such as borderline repeat numbers), which can be stressful and create uncertainty. The waiting times for appointments and results may also add to anxiety.

                    The test itself involves analysing the person’s DNA - using a laboratory method called PCR - to count how many CAG repeats are present in the HTT gene. Refer back to table 1 when thinking about what impact the number of repeats implies.

                    Predictive testing for Huntington’s disease during pregnancy raises several important ethical and emotional concerns. Because the test is carried out before birth, the future child has no opportunity to choose whether they want this information, even though many at-risk adults later decide they would rather not know. Receiving results during pregnancy can place significant emotional strain on parents, especially when a positive result forces them to consider extremely difficult decisions. For some families, a positive result may lead to discussions about termination, which introduces complex ethical questions, as views on termination vary widely between individuals, cultures, and religions. Prenatal testing can also unintentionally reveal information about the parents themselves, such as their own carrier status, which they may not have wished to learn and which could affect future reproductive choices. In addition, results are not always clear-cut; some fall into “reduced penetrance” or “intermediate” ranges, creating uncertainty that can make decisions even more challenging. Parents may also feel pressure - from family, society, or even healthcare professionals - to test their pregnancy, but it is essential that this decision is made freely and without external influence

                <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                    Deciding whether to have genetic testing for Huntington’s disease as an adult is a personal and often very difficult choice. Because there is currently no cure or treatment that can prevent or reverse the disease, some people feel there is little practical benefit in knowing they carry the mutation years before symptoms appear. For some, receiving a positive result could cause significant emotional stress, anxiety, or low mood, and they would rather live without this knowledge. These individuals may worry that knowing their result too early might affect their ability to enjoy life or plan for the future.

                <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                    However, others choose to have the test because they want to remove the uncertainty of not knowing. A definite results (whether positive or negative) can help people to make informed decisions about major life plans, such as:

                    <li>Arranging long term care or support</li>
                    <li>Discussing the future with partners and family</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                    Some people also feel that knowing their genetic status helps them prepare emotionally, practically, and psychologically for whatever the future holds.
                </p>
                <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
                    The decision can be further complicated by concerns about health insurance, employment, and how the result might affect relationships with partners or family members. This is why adult predictive testing always includes support from genetic counsellors, who can help people think through all of these factors before choosing whether or not to be tested.

                <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
                    Huntington’s disease raises difficult questions about testing, choice, and the future. Although modern genetic tests can tell us with certainty whether someone has Huntington's mutation, there is still no cure, and the emotional, practical, and ethical implications are different for every person and every family. Some people feel testing gives clarity and control, while others prefer not to know. The same is true for prenatal testing, which can guide important decisions but also brings complex issues around consent, uncertainty and ethics. Ultimately, there is no single “right” answer. The decision to test, whether in adulthood or during pregnancy, is personal, and should be supported by clear information, counselling, and respect for individual values.
