It's a website, built using the [Cursor](https://cursor.com/) AI code editor.

It uses [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for styling and a little Javascript.

## Prompts used

This is fairly straightforward, but here's the prompts used to build the page:

Setup
> Creating a single HTML page with Tailwind CDN, 5 sections, and a toggle between linear and tabbed views.

It didn't quite work, so fix this:
> When you toggle tabbed view on and off an then back on, it stays on linear view

Fix styles
> hover text on the tabs should be black

Better page hierarchy
> I think we need a single h1 at the top to say what the page is about, and each section should be h2 and below

Mobile support
> make it mobile friendly, so that smaller screens have a hamburger button

Better toggling
> When you click on the text of either
> - Linear View
> - Tabbed View
>   
> It should correctly toggle the button/view
